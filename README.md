# test-blackjackhand

My solution for Chapter 5 Exercise 4 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Problem Description:
The BlackjackHand class from Subsection 5.5.1 is an extension of the Hand class from
Section 5.4. The instance methods in the Hand class are discussed in that section. In addition
to those methods, BlackjackHand includes an instance method, getBlackjackValue(),
which returns the value of the hand for the game of Blackjack. For this exercise, you will
also need the Deck and Card classes from Section 5.4.
A Blackjack hand typically contains from two to six cards. Write a program to test the
BlackjackHand class. You should create a BlackjackHand object and a Deck object. Pick
a random number between 2 and 6. Deal that many cards from the deck and add them to
the hand. Print out all the cards in the hand, and then print out the value computed for
the hand by getBlackjackValue(). Repeat this as long as the user wants to continue.
In addition to TextIO.java, your program will depend on Card.java, Deck.java,
Hand.java, and BlackjackHand.java.

Notes: This project relies on the Card.java, Deck.java, Hand.java, TextIO.java, and 
BlackjackHand.java written by the textbook's author.
